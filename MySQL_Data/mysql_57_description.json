This socket is bound to a single address, but it\n          is possible for an address to map onto multiple network\n          interfaces. To specify an address, set bind_address= addr at server startup, where addr is an\n          IPv4 or IPv6 address or a host name. If addr is a host name, the server\n          resolves the name to an IP address and binds to that address.\n          If a host name resolves to multiple IP addresses, the server\n          uses the first IPv4 address if there are any, or the first\n          IPv6 address otherwise. The server treats different types of addresses as follows: If the address is * , the server accepts\n              TCP/IP connections on all server host IPv4 interfaces,\n              and, if the server host supports IPv6, on all IPv6\n              interfaces. Use this address to permit both IPv4 and IPv6\n              connections on all server interfaces. This value is the\n              default. If the address is 0.0.0.0 , the server\n              accepts TCP/IP connections on all server host IPv4\n              interfaces. If the address is :: , the server\n              accepts TCP/IP connections on all server host IPv4 and\n              IPv6 interfaces. If the address is an IPv4-mapped address, the server\n              accepts TCP/IP connections for that address, in either\n              IPv4 or IPv6 format. For example, if the server is bound\n              to ::ffff:127.0.0.1 , clients can\n              connect using --host=127.0.0.1 or --host=::ffff:127.0.0.1 . If the address is a “ regular ” IPv4 or IPv6\n              address (such as 127.0.0.1 or ::1 ), the server accepts TCP/IP\n              connections only for that IPv4 or IPv6 address. If binding to the address fails, the server produces an error\n          and does not start. If you intend to bind the server to a specific address, be\n          sure that the mysql.user system table\n          contains an account with administrative privileges that you\n          can use to connect to that address. Otherwise, you cannot shut\n          down the server. For example, if you bind the server to * , you can connect to it using all existing\n          accounts. But if you bind the server to ::1 , it accepts connections only on that\n          address. In that case, first make sure that the 'root'@'::1' account is present in the mysql.user table so you can still connect\n          to the server to shut it down.

RELEASE (or 2) COMMIT and ROLLBACK are equivalent to COMMIT RELEASE and ROLLBACK RELEASE , respectively. (The\n                server disconnects after terminating the transaction.) completion_type affects\n          transactions that begin with START\n          TRANSACTION or BEGIN and\n          end with COMMIT or ROLLBACK . It\n          does not apply to implicit commits resulting from execution of\n          the statements listed in Section 13.3.3, “Statements That Cause an Implicit Commit” . It\n          also does not apply for XA\n          COMMIT , XA\n          ROLLBACK , or when autocommit=1 ."

By default, explicit_defaults_for_timestamp is disabled, which enables the nonstandard behaviors. If explicit_defaults_for_timestamp is disabled, the server enables the nonstandard behaviors and\n          handles TIMESTAMP columns as\n          follows: TIMESTAMP columns not\n              explicitly declared with the NULL attribute are automatically declared with the NOT\n              NULL attribute. Assigning such a column a value\n              of NULL is permitted and sets the\n              column to the current timestamp. The first TIMESTAMP column\n              in a table, if not explicitly declared with the NULL attribute or an explicit DEFAULT or ON UPDATE attribute, is automatically declared with the DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP and ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP attributes. TIMESTAMP columns following\n              the first one, if not explicitly declared with the NULL attribute or an explicit DEFAULT attribute, are automatically\n              declared as DEFAULT '0000-00-00\n              00:00:00' (the “ zero ” timestamp).\n              For inserted rows that specify no explicit value for such\n              a column, the column is assigned '0000-00-00\n              00:00:00' and no warning occurs. Depending on whether strict SQL mode or the NO_ZERO_DATE SQL mode is\n              enabled, a default value of '0000-00-00\n              00:00:00' may be invalid. Be aware that the TRADITIONAL SQL mode\n              includes strict mode and NO_ZERO_DATE . See Section 5.1.10, “Server SQL Modes” . The nonstandard behaviors just described are deprecated;\n          expect them to be removed in a future release of MySQL. If explicit_defaults_for_timestamp is enabled, the server disables the nonstandard behaviors and\n          handles TIMESTAMP columns as\n          follows: It is not possible to assign a TIMESTAMP column a value of NULL to set it to the current\n              timestamp. To assign the current timestamp, set the column\n              to CURRENT_TIMESTAMP or a\n              synonym such as NOW() . TIMESTAMP columns not\n              explicitly declared with the NOT NULL attribute are automatically declared with the NULL attribute and permit NULL values. Assigning such a column a\n              value of NULL sets it to NULL , not the current timestamp. TIMESTAMP columns declared\n              with the NOT NULL attribute do not\n              permit NULL values. For inserts that\n              specify NULL for such a column, the\n              result is either an error for a single-row insert if\n              strict SQL mode is enabled, or '0000-00-00\n              00:00:00' is inserted for multiple-row inserts\n              with strict SQL mode disabled. In no case does assigning\n              the column a value of NULL set it to\n              the current timestamp. TIMESTAMP columns\n              explicitly declared with the NOT NULL attribute and without an explicit DEFAULT attribute are treated as having\n              no default value. For inserted rows that specify no\n              explicit value for such a column, the result depends on\n              the SQL mode. If strict SQL mode is enabled, an error\n              occurs. If strict SQL mode is not enabled, the column is\n              declared with the implicit default of '0000-00-00\n              00:00:00' and a warning occurs. This is similar\n              to how MySQL treats other temporal types such as DATETIME . No TIMESTAMP column is\n              automatically declared with the DEFAULT\n              CURRENT_TIMESTAMP or ON UPDATE\n              CURRENT_TIMESTAMP attributes. Those attributes\n              must be explicitly specified. The first TIMESTAMP column\n              in a table is not handled differently from TIMESTAMP columns following\n              the first one. If explicit_defaults_for_timestamp is disabled at server startup, this warning appears in the\n          error log: Press CTRL+C to copy [ Warning ] TIMESTAMP with implicit DEFAULT value is deprecated . Please use -- explicit_defaults_for_timestamp server option ( see\ndocumentation for more details ) . As indicated by the warning, to disable the deprecated\n          nonstandard behaviors, enable the explicit_defaults_for_timestamp system variable at server startup. Note explicit_defaults_for_timestamp is itself deprecated because its only purpose is to permit\n            control over deprecated TIMESTAMP behaviors that are\n            to be removed in a future release of MySQL. When removal of\n            those behaviors occurs, explicit_defaults_for_timestamp no longer has any purpose, and you can expect it to be\n            removed as well.

Setting host_cache_size has these\n          effects: Setting the size to 0 disables the host cache. With the\n              cache disabled, the server performs a DNS lookup every\n              time a client connects. Changing the size at runtime causes an implicit host cache\n              flushing operation that clears the host cache, truncates\n              the host_cache table, and\n              unblocks any blocked hosts.

Using the --skip-host-cache option is similar to setting the host_cache_size system variable to 0, but host_cache_size is more flexible because it\n          can also be used to resize, enable, and disable the host cache\n          at runtime, not just at server startup.

Setting the host_cache_size system variable\n          rather than the --skip-host-cache option is\n          preferred for the reasons given in the previous paragraph.

Normally, the best way to\n          get fast joins is to add indexes. Increase the value of join_buffer_size to get a\n          faster full join when adding indexes is not possible. One join\n          buffer is allocated for each full join between two tables. For\n          a complex join between several tables for which indexes are\n          not used, multiple join buffers might be necessary. The default is 256KB. The maximum permissible setting for join_buffer_size is 4GB−1. Larger values are permitted for 64-bit\n          platforms (except 64-bit Windows, for which large values are\n          truncated to 4GB−1 with a warning). The block size is\n          128, and a value that is not an exact multiple of the block\n          size is rounded down to the next lower multiple of the block\n          size by MySQL Server before storing the value for the system\n          variable. The parser allows values up to the maximum unsigned\n          integer value for the platform (4294967295 or\n          2 32 −1 for a 32-bit system,\n          18446744073709551615 or 2 64 −1\n          for a 64-bit system) but the actual maximum is a block size\n          lower. Unless a Block Nested-Loop or Batched Key Access algorithm is\n          used, there is no gain from setting the buffer larger than\n          required to hold each matching row, and all joins allocate at\n          least the minimum size, so use caution in setting this\n          variable to a large value globally. It is better to keep the\n          global setting small and change the session setting to a\n          larger value only in sessions that are doing large joins.\n          Memory allocation time can cause substantial performance drops\n          if the global size is larger than needed by most queries that\n          use it. When Block Nested-Loop is used, a larger join buffer can be\n          beneficial up to the point where all required columns from all\n          rows in the first table are stored in the join buffer. This\n          depends on the query; the optimal size may be smaller than\n          holding all rows from the first tables. When Batched Key Access is used, the value of join_buffer_size defines how\n          large the batch of keys is in each request to the storage\n          engine. The larger the buffer, the more sequential access is\n          made to the right hand table of a join operation, which can\n          significantly improve performance.

The key buffer is also\n          known as the key cache. The minimum permissible setting is 0, but you cannot set key_buffer_size to 0\n          dynamically. A setting of 0 drops the key cache, which is not\n          permitted at runtime. Setting key_buffer_size to 0 is\n          permitted only at startup, in which case the key cache is not\n          initialized. Changing the key_buffer_size setting at\n          runtime from a value of 0 to a permitted non-zero value\n          initializes the key cache. key_buffer_size can be\n          increased or decreased only in increments or multiples of 4096\n          bytes. Increasing or decreasing the setting by a nonconforming\n          value produces a warning and truncates the setting to a\n          conforming value. The maximum permissible setting for key_buffer_size is\n          4GB−1 on 32-bit platforms. Larger values are permitted\n          for 64-bit platforms. The effective maximum size might be\n          less, depending on your available physical RAM and per-process\n          RAM limits imposed by your operating system or hardware\n          platform. The value of this variable indicates the amount of\n          memory requested. Internally, the server allocates as much\n          memory as possible up to this amount, but the actual\n          allocation might be less. You can increase the value to get better index handling for\n          all reads and multiple writes; on a system whose primary\n          function is to run MySQL using the MyISAM storage engine, 25% of the\n          machine's total memory is an acceptable value for this\n          variable. However, you should be aware that, if you make the\n          value too large (for example, more than 50% of the\n          machine's total memory), your system might start to page\n          and become extremely slow. This is because MySQL relies on the\n          operating system to perform file system caching for data\n          reads, so you must leave some room for the file system cache.\n          You should also consider the memory requirements of any other\n          storage engines that you may be using in addition to MyISAM . For even more speed when writing many rows at the same time,\n          use LOCK TABLES . See Section 8.2.4.1, “Optimizing INSERT Statements” . You can check the performance of the key buffer by issuing a SHOW STATUS statement and\n          examining the Key_read_requests , Key_reads , Key_write_requests , and Key_writes status variables.\n          (See Section 13.7.5, “SHOW Statements” .) The Key_reads/Key_read_requests ratio should\n          normally be less than 0.01. The Key_writes/Key_write_requests ratio is\n          usually near 1 if you are using mostly updates and deletes,\n          but might be much smaller if you tend to do updates that\n          affect many rows at the same time or if you are using the DELAY_KEY_WRITE table option. The fraction of the key buffer in use can be determined using key_buffer_size in\n          conjunction with the Key_blocks_unused status\n          variable and the buffer block size, which is available from\n          the key_cache_block_size system variable: Press CTRL+C to copy 1 - ( ( Key_blocks_unused * key_cache_block_size ) / key_buffer_size ) This value is an approximation because some space in the key\n          buffer is allocated internally for administrative structures.\n          Factors that influence the amount of overhead for these\n          structures include block size and pointer size. As block size\n          increases, the percentage of the key buffer lost to overhead\n          tends to decrease. Larger blocks results in a smaller number\n          of read operations (because more keys are obtained per read),\n          but conversely an increase in reads of keys that are not\n          examined (if not all keys in a block are relevant to a query). It is possible to create multiple MyISAM key caches. The size limit of 4GB applies to each cache\n          individually, not as a group. See Section 8.10.2, “The MyISAM Key Cache” ."

If the value is greater than 0,\n          the server logs messages about statements that are unsafe for\n          statement-based logging. If the value is greater than 1, the\n          server logs aborted connections and access-denied errors for\n          new connection attempts. See Section B.3.2.9, “Communication Errors and Aborted Connections” . If you use replication, enabling this variable by setting it\n          greater than 0 is recommended, to get more information about\n          what is happening, such as messages about network failures and\n          reconnections. If a replica server is started with log_warnings enabled, the\n          replica prints messages to the error log to provide\n          information about its status, such as the binary log and relay\n          log coordinates where it starts its job, when it is switching\n          to another relay log, when it reconnects after a disconnect,\n          and so forth. Assigning a value to log_warnings assigns a value\n          to log_error_verbosity and\n          vice versa. The variables are related as follows: Suppression of all log_warnings items,\n              achieved with log_warnings=0 , is\n              achieved with log_error_verbosity=1 (errors only). Items printed for log_warnings=1 or higher\n              count as warnings and are printed for log_error_verbosity=2 or\n              higher. Items printed for log_warnings=2 count as\n              notes and are printed for log_error_verbosity=3 . As of MySQL 5.7.2, the default log level is controlled by log_error_verbosity , which\n          has a default of 3. In addition, the default for log_warnings changes from 1\n          to 2, which corresponds to log_error_verbosity=3 . To\n          achieve a logging level similar to the previous default, set log_error_verbosity=2 . In MySQL 5.7.2 and higher, use of log_warnings is still\n          permitted but maps onto use of log_error_verbosity as\n          follows: Setting log_warnings=0 is\n              equivalent to log_error_verbosity=1 (errors only). Setting log_warnings=1 is\n              equivalent to log_error_verbosity=2 (errors, warnings). Setting log_warnings=2 (or higher) is equivalent to log_error_verbosity=3 (errors, warnings, notes), and the server sets log_warnings to 2 if a\n              larger value is specified."

As of\n          MySQL 5.7.6, the Performance Schema also contains system and\n          status variable tables (see Section 25.12.13, “Performance Schema System Variable Tables” ,\n          and Section 25.12.14, “Performance Schema Status Variable Tables” ).\n          The Performance Schema tables are intended to replace the INFORMATION_SCHEMA tables, which are\n          deprecated as of MySQL 5.7.6 and are removed in MySQL\n          8.0. For advice on migrating away from the INFORMATION_SCHEMA tables to the\n          Performance Schema tables, see Section 25.20, “Migrating to Performance Schema System and Status Variable Tables” .\n          To assist in the migration, you can use the show_compatibility_56 system\n          variable, which affects whether MySQL 5.6 compatibility is\n          enabled with respect to how system and status variable\n          information is provided by the INFORMATION_SCHEMA and Performance Schema\n          tables, and also by the SHOW\n          VARIABLES and SHOW\n          STATUS statements. Note show_compatibility_56 is\n            deprecated because its only purpose is to permit control\n            over deprecated system and status variable information\n            sources which you can expect to be removed in a future\n            release of MySQL. When those sources are removed, show_compatibility_56 no\n            longer has any purpose, and you can expect it be removed as\n            well. The following discussion describes the effects of show_compatibility_56 : Overview of show_compatibility_56 Effects Effect of show_compatibility_56 on SHOW Statements Effect of show_compatibility_56 on INFORMATION_SCHEMA Tables Effect of show_compatibility_56 on Performance Schema Tables Effect of show_compatibility_56 on Slave Status Variables Effect of show_compatibility_56 on FLUSH STATUS For better understanding, it is strongly recommended that you\n          also read these sections: Section 25.12.13, “Performance Schema System Variable Tables” Section 25.12.14, “Performance Schema Status Variable Tables” Section 25.12.15.10, “Status Variable Summary Tables” Overview of show_compatibility_56 Effects The show_compatibility_56 system variable affects these aspects of server operation\n          regarding system and status variables: Information available from the SHOW\n              VARIABLES and SHOW\n              STATUS statements Information available from the INFORMATION_SCHEMA tables that provide\n              system and status variable information Information available from the Performance Schema tables\n              that provide system and status variable information The effect of the FLUSH\n              STATUS statement on status variables This list summarizes the effects of show_compatibility_56 , with\n          additional details given later: When show_compatibility_56 is ON , compatibility with MySQL 5.6 is\n              enabled. Older variable information sources\n              ( SHOW statements, INFORMATION_SCHEMA tables) produce the\n              same output as in MySQL 5.6. When show_compatibility_56 is OFF , compatibility with MySQL 5.6 is\n              disabled. Selecting from the INFORMATION_SCHEMA tables produces an\n              error because the Performance Schema tables are intended\n              to replace them. The INFORMATION_SCHEMA tables are deprecated as of MySQL 5.7.6 and are removed in\n              MySQL 8.0. To obtain system and status variable information When show_compatibility_56=OFF ,\n              use the Performance Schema tables or the SHOW statements. Note When show_compatibility_56=OFF ,\n                the SHOW VARIABLES and SHOW STATUS statements\n                display rows from the Performance Schema global_variables , session_variables , global_status , and session_status tables. As of MySQL 5.7.9, those tables are world readable and\n                accessible without the SELECT privilege, which\n                means that SELECT is not\n                needed to use the SHOW statements,\n                either. Before MySQL 5.7.9, the SELECT privilege is\n                required to access those Performance Schema tables,\n                either directly, or indirectly through the SHOW statements. Several Slave_ xxx status variables are available from SHOW STATUS when show_compatibility_56 is ON . When show_compatibility_56 is OFF , some of those variables are not\n              exposed to SHOW STATUS . The\n              information they provide is available in\n              replication-related Performance Schema tables, as\n              described later. show_compatibility_56 has\n              no effect on system variable access using @@ notation: @@GLOBAL. var_name , @@SESSION. var_name , @@ var_name . show_compatibility_56 has\n              no effect for the embedded server, which produces\n              5.6-compatible output in all cases. The following descriptions detail the effect of setting show_compatibility_56 to ON or OFF in the\n          contexts in which this variable applies. Effect of show_compatibility_56 on SHOW Statements SHOW GLOBAL\n          VARIABLES statement: ON : MySQL 5.6 output. OFF : Output displays rows from the\n              Performance Schema global_variables table. SHOW [SESSION\n          | LOCAL] VARIABLES statement: ON : MySQL 5.6 output. OFF : Output displays rows from the\n              Performance Schema session_variables table. (In\n              MySQL 5.7.6 and 5.7.7, OFF output does\n              not fully reflect all system variable values in effect for\n              the current session; it includes no rows for global\n              variables that have no session counterpart. This is\n              corrected in MySQL 5.7.8.) SHOW GLOBAL\n          STATUS statement: ON : MySQL 5.6 output. OFF : Output displays rows from the\n              Performance Schema global_status table, plus the Com_ xxx statement execution counters. OFF output includes no rows for session\n              variables that have no global counterpart, unlike ON output. SHOW [SESSION |\n          LOCAL] STATUS statement: ON : MySQL 5.6 output. OFF : Output displays rows from the\n              Performance Schema session_status table, plus\n              the Com_ xxx statement execution counters. (In MySQL 5.7.6 and 5.7.7, OFF output does not fully reflect all\n              status variable values in effect for the current session;\n              it includes no rows for global variables that have no\n              session counterpart. This is corrected in MySQL 5.7.8.) In MySQL 5.7.6 and 5.7.7, for each of the SHOW statements just described, use of a WHERE clause produces a warning when show_compatibility_56=ON and an error when show_compatibility_56=OFF . (This applies to WHERE clauses that are not optimized away.\n          For example, WHERE 1 is trivially true, is\n          optimized away, and thus produces no warning or error.) This\n          behavior does not occur as of MySQL 5.7.8; WHERE is supported as before 5.7.6. Effect of show_compatibility_56 on INFORMATION_SCHEMA Tables INFORMATION_SCHEMA tables\n          ( GLOBAL_VARIABLES , SESSION_VARIABLES , GLOBAL_STATUS , and SESSION_STATUS ): ON : MySQL 5.6 output, with a\n              deprecation warning.

Effect of show_compatibility_56 on Slave Status Variables Replica status variables: ON : Several Slave_ xxx status variables are available from SHOW STATUS . OFF : Some of those replica variables\n              are not exposed to SHOW\n              STATUS or the Performance Schema status variable\n              tables. The information they provide is available in\n              replication-related Performance Schema tables. The\n              following table shows which Slave_ xxx status variables become unavailable in SHOW STATUS and their\n              locations in Performance Schema replication tables. Status Variable Performance Schema Location Slave_heartbeat_period replication_connection_configuration table, HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL column Slave_last_heartbeat replication_connection_status table, LAST_HEARTBEAT_TIMESTAMP column Slave_received_heartbeats replication_connection_status table, COUNT_RECEIVED_HEARTBEATS column Slave_retried_transactions replication_applier_status table, COUNT_TRANSACTIONS_RETRIES column Slave_running replication_connection_status and replication_applier_status tables, SERVICE_STATE column Effect of show_compatibility_56 on FLUSH STATUS FLUSH STATUS statement: ON : This statement produces MySQL 5.6\n              behavior. It adds the current thread's session status\n              variable values to the global values and resets the\n              session values to zero.

Older variable information sources\n              ( SHOW statements, INFORMATION_SCHEMA tables) produce the\n              same output as in MySQL 5.6. When show_compatibility_56 is OFF , compatibility with MySQL 5.6 is\n              disabled. Selecting from the INFORMATION_SCHEMA tables produces an\n              error because the Performance Schema tables are intended\n              to replace them. The INFORMATION_SCHEMA tables are deprecated as of MySQL 5.7.6 and are removed in\n              MySQL 8.0. To obtain system and status variable information When show_compatibility_56=OFF ,\n              use the Performance Schema tables or the SHOW statements. Note When show_compatibility_56=OFF ,\n                the SHOW VARIABLES and SHOW STATUS statements\n                display rows from the Performance Schema global_variables , session_variables , global_status , and session_status tables. As of MySQL 5.7.9, those tables are world readable and\n                accessible without the SELECT privilege, which\n                means that SELECT is not\n                needed to use the SHOW statements,\n                either. Before MySQL 5.7.9, the SELECT privilege is\n                required to access those Performance Schema tables,\n                either directly, or indirectly through the SHOW statements. Several Slave_ xxx status variables are available from SHOW STATUS when show_compatibility_56 is ON . When show_compatibility_56 is OFF , some of those variables are not\n              exposed to SHOW STATUS . The\n              information they provide is available in\n              replication-related Performance Schema tables, as\n              described later. show_compatibility_56 has\n              no effect on system variable access using @@ notation: @@GLOBAL. var_name , @@SESSION. var_name , @@ var_name . show_compatibility_56 has\n              no effect for the embedded server, which produces\n              5.6-compatible output in all cases. The following descriptions detail the effect of setting show_compatibility_56 to ON or OFF in the\n          contexts in which this variable applies. Effect of show_compatibility_56 on SHOW Statements SHOW GLOBAL\n          VARIABLES statement: ON : MySQL 5.6 output. OFF : Output displays rows from the\n              Performance Schema global_variables table. SHOW [SESSION\n          | LOCAL] VARIABLES statement: ON : MySQL 5.6 output. OFF : Output displays rows from the\n              Performance Schema session_variables table. (In\n              MySQL 5.7.6 and 5.7.7, OFF output does\n              not fully reflect all system variable values in effect for\n              the current session; it includes no rows for global\n              variables that have no session counterpart. This is\n              corrected in MySQL 5.7.8.) SHOW GLOBAL\n          STATUS statement: ON : MySQL 5.6 output. OFF : Output displays rows from the\n              Performance Schema global_status table, plus the Com_ xxx statement execution counters. OFF output includes no rows for session\n              variables that have no global counterpart, unlike ON output. SHOW [SESSION |\n          LOCAL] STATUS statement: ON : MySQL 5.6 output. OFF : Output displays rows from the\n              Performance Schema session_status table, plus\n              the Com_ xxx statement execution counters.

This is corrected in MySQL 5.7.8.) In MySQL 5.7.6 and 5.7.7, for each of the SHOW statements just described, use of a WHERE clause produces a warning when show_compatibility_56=ON and an error when show_compatibility_56=OFF . (This applies to WHERE clauses that are not optimized away.\n          For example, WHERE 1 is trivially true, is\n          optimized away, and thus produces no warning or error.) This\n          behavior does not occur as of MySQL 5.7.8; WHERE is supported as before 5.7.6. Effect of show_compatibility_56 on INFORMATION_SCHEMA Tables INFORMATION_SCHEMA tables\n          ( GLOBAL_VARIABLES , SESSION_VARIABLES , GLOBAL_STATUS , and SESSION_STATUS ): ON : MySQL 5.6 output, with a\n              deprecation warning.
